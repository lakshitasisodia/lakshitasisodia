I’m Lakshita — a product-focused full-stack engineer who ships scalable web apps, DevOps pipelines, and AI-powered tools. I specialize in taking products from idea to deployment using real-world stacks and architecture-first thinking.

I don’t just follow roadmaps — I **am** the roadmap: built through depth-first learning, tested in production, and shared in public.
